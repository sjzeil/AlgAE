<P>Some animations that you might run are designed to show off a
single particular algorithm on a fixed set of data. These will
tpyically be running as soon as you see the animation controller. 
Often these will run in a continuous loop.</P>
<P>Other animations will offer you a choice of related algorithms
that you may select among. Often you will be asked for the specific
input values that you would like to pass to the selected algorithms. 
You will find these choices available to you in the <B>Algorithms</B>
menu.</P>
<P>The Algorithms menu will be disabled (grayed-out) once a function
you have selected starts running, and will be re-enabled once that
function has finished</P>

<P>The controls at the bottom of the window allow you to pause,
rewind, and restart the animations in progress.</P>
<P>Most animations, be default, will run just a step at a time,
pausing frequently so that you can view the data and compare to the
code being executed, until you decide to tell the animation to move
forward one step.  The designer of each particular animation will set
a number of <I>breakpoints</I> that he/she considers to be the
“natural” or most instructive places to pause.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/pause.gif" NAME="pause" ALT="pause" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
is the <I>pause</I> button.  Click this during a running animation to
pause at the next breakpoint . If you have previously run through a
function with the <I>run without pausing</I> button (below), then
clicking this button will restore the normal “pause at each
breakpoint” behavior for the next function that you select from the
<B>Algorithms</B> menu.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/step.gif" NAME="step" ALT="step" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
is the <I>step</I> button.  Clicking this when an animation is paused
will move allow the algorithm to resume running but will pause at the
next breakpoint.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/play.gif" NAME="play" ALT="play" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
is the <I>play without pausing</I> button. Clicking this when an
animation is paused will move allow the algorithm to resume running
and it will continue to run, past any future breakpoints, until
either the selection function is completed or until you click on the
<I>pause</I> button.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/rewind.gif" NAME="rewind" ALT="rewind" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=24 BORDER=0>
is the <I>rewind</I> button. Clicking this when an animation is
paused will rewind the animation  to the most recent breakpoint.
Pressing it repeatedly will move you further backwards in time. Use
the <I>step</I> or <I>play without pausing</I> buttons to resume
moving forwards again. (Note: if you rewind past a point at which the
algorithm asked you to supply input, you will not be asked for that
input again. The same input values will be used.)</P>

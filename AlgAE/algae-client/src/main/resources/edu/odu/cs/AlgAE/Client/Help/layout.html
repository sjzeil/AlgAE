<H1>Layout</H1>
<P>The basic AlgAE window has three main components:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/AlgAE_layout.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=741 HEIGHT=470 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>The <I>drawing area</I> shows a picture of the data
	structures being manipulated by the algorithm as it is running. Each
	data object is portrayed as a box. Pointers or references between
	objects are drawn as arrows.<BR><BR>AlgAE tries to arrange the boxes
	on the page so that the interconnections between operations can be
	perceived easily. If you don't like the arrange, you can move boxes
	around by clicking on a box and dragging it to a new location.<BR>
	<BR>Most animations will have a special object in the upper left
	corner. This represents the <I>call stack</I> (a.k.a. the <I>activation
	stack</I>) showing all function calls that are active at the moment,
	including the parameters passed to those calls.<BR><BR>If the
	picture of the data extends past the edges of the drawing area, then
	scroll bars will appear that will allow you to move around the
	viewing space.  You can also use the <I>zoom</I> control to zoom in
	and out on the data picture.</P>
	<LI><P>The <I>code area</I> shows the source code for the algorithm
	that is running. The current line of code about to be executed is
	highlighted in red.  You can use the scroll bars to view other parts
	of the source code file. If the code being executed is split among
	multiple files, you can use the selector at the bottom to look at
	whichever file you want.</P>
	<LI><P>The <I>I/O area</I> shows any output written by the code to
	the standard output (i.e., cout in C++ or System.out in Java) and
	has a text entry box at the bottom in which you can type any input
	to be supplied to standard input (i.e., cin in C++ or System.in in
	Java)</P>
</OL>
<P>The borders separating these 3 areas can be dragged from left to
right or up and down to re-arrange the amount of space used for each
area. For example, many algorithms will make little use of standard
I/O, so you might want to give more room to the code area.</P>

#AlgAE  - Algorithm Animation Engine

AlgAE   is   a  framework   for   quick   construction  of   algorithm
animations. AlgAE  is aimed at computer science  instructors who, like
myself,  use  projectors  to  display  computer video  output  in  the
classroom or who teach  distance (web-based courses in programming and
data structures.

AlgAE allows the instructor to take typical Java code from a course's
textbook or lecture notes and, with relatively little effort, produce
an "animated" version of that code. These animations will show the
data as it is being manipulated by the code. A listing of the
algorithm source code is synchronized with the animation. Because
these animations are "live", students can interact with the algorithm,
supplying their own input data values and watching the resulting
calculation.

Animations can run continuously or can pause at instructor-selected
breakpoints. At each breakpoint, the instructor decides what variables
should be drawn, what text to display in the status line, and if
desired, how to use color and other cues to highlight the more
instructive portions of the data.

AlgAE 's goal is to let an instructor quickly animate code obtained
from the course's textbook or the instructor's own slides, and to
display these animations in a classroom setting (relatively few
objects on the screen, but drawn large enough to be visible in a large
classroom) or embed them into a web page.
